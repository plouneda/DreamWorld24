DreamForge Integration Testing README

Integration tests for the DreamForge project involve testing the interaction between different components of the system. As such, they may require setting up a test environment and simulating user interactions.

Since integration testing is highly dependent on the specific components and functionalities of the project, follow these general guidelines:

1. Identify the key integration points within the DreamForge project, such as interactions between modules, APIs, or user interfaces.

2. Develop integration test scenarios that cover these integration points, focusing on typical user workflows and system interactions.

3. Implement the integration test scenarios using a testing framework such as unittest or pytest.

4. Set up any necessary test data or fixtures to simulate real-world conditions.

5. Run the integration tests and analyze the results to ensure that the components of the system interact correctly and produce the expected outcomes.

6. Make any necessary adjustments to the project code based on the results of the integration tests.
